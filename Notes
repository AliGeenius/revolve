Main selling points. 
 - $99 MRSP for entry level 4 driver (or TMC2208) version.
 - 12-24 V input, limited by step down converters. 
 - 4 - 6 Stepper TMC2130 drivers
 - 4 thermistor inputs
 - 4 thermocouple inputs
 - 4 USB connectors. 
 - 4 USR leds, perhaps one for Redeem heartbeat. 
 - CE and FCC markings.
 - Direct connection PRU on step pins, perhaps also on dir and endstops. 
 - 48MByte/sec eMMC booting. Focus on fast boot-up. 


Design goals:
 - Sub 1 minute boot time to OctoPrint. 
 - USB Live-image distro. 
 - Power out detection. 
 - STEP/DIR direct control to PRU. 
 - Stepper Vin up to 46V? 
 - Heater/board Vin up to 24V? 

Involved parties: 
 - BB.org: Official stamp, community, lower prices. 
 - Aleph Objects: B2B customer, software support. 
 - OSH park: PCB prototypes and early PR. 
 - Seeed Studio: PCB+PCBA, component sourcing, Re-seller, shipping. 
 - Crowd Supply: Crowd funding, pre-order, pre-launch. 
 - Ultimachine: Component sourcing, PCBA, distribution. 

TODO: 
 + Switch to AM335x-SM
 - Switch to TMC2130
 - Add CGND for ESD shielding
 - 4 layer
 - Switch step down and USB hub to TI components.
 - Connect VDDCR
 - Over voltage protection on USB
 - Support for Thermistor and Thermocouple
 - MCASP0_AXR1



TO_VERIFY: 
 - USB self powered. OK to tie high to USB_DC?
 - Two boot modes, USB for flashing and running, EMMC for running. USB device for initial setup. 
 - USR leds, do they need a transistor? A: No. 
 - Perhaps higher power step down converter? A: Use TPS54202 - 2A.
 - Put 
 - Use Peripheral PLL for RTC? 
 - What is the 125MHz limitation on the HDMI? 
    The TDA19988 handles up to 150MHz, 
    The LCDC looks like it can have a pixel clock up to 200 MHz. 

SAVE_COST:
 - Remove microSD slot. Flash/boot from USB instead. 
 - Remove Serial to parallel converters. 
 - Remove RTC crystal? 
 - 4 stepper version. 
 - Source Electrolytic Capacitors from China. 
 - Use built in PWM_SS, remove PWM-chip. 
 - Consider lower cost connectors from China. 
 - Surface mount components wherever possible. (USB connector,.. )
 - Single side assembly. 
 - 4 layer 6 mil track/gap PCB
 - Switch to 25MHz Crystal on SIP, can also be used for Ethernet?
